Started in 2015, Wentworth Institute of Technology Financial Investment Club started as a program aimed at teaching student the fundamentals of investing. Our first sessions started with teaching about fundamental investing and exploring different algorithmic trading strategies. From those first quantopian algorithms and talks about the problems with crypto-currencies not much time has passed, but the club is working on growing into a thriving culture of business minded students.
